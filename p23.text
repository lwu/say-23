Psalm 23A psalm of David.1 The Lord is my shepherd, I lack nothing.2     He makes me lie down in green pastures,he leads me beside quiet waters,3     he refreshes my soul.He guides me along the right pathsfor his name’s sake.4 Even though I walkthrough the darkest valley,[a]I will fear no evil,for you are with me;your rod and your staff,they comfort me.5 You prepare a table before mein the presence of my enemies.You anoint my head with oil;my cup overflows.6 Surely your goodness and love will follow meall the days of my life,and I will dwell in the house of the Lordforever.
