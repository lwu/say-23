Stanford Code Poetry Slam entry
November 2013

Leslie Wu <lwu2@cs.stanford.edu>

## installation

'gem install nokogiri' via rubygems if needed.

## performance

Either memorize the poem or use slam.el in Emacs to present via buffer-mirroring.

Performer should understand the difference between ` and '.

Here is a guide:
http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2008/06/ascii-pronunciation-rules-for-programmers.html 

The first # (L1) is silent, the second (L2) is 'hashtag'. L3 hash could go either way.

Otherwise, please say 'hash' or  'pound sign' and not 'hashtag' for #, and 'single quote' or 'apostrophe' not 'quote' for '.

For ` use backquote or left single quote. Possibly even tic.

Say dot instead of period. You can say 'open brace' 'close brace' for { } and pipe for |.

One reading is found in file 'say23.english'.

#thx
